# Divvy Bike Sharing Data

The Divvy Bike Sharing data is a comprehensive dataset that provides historical trip data for public use. This data is released on a monthly schedule and is provided according to the Divvy Data License Agreement.

## Data Content

Each trip in the dataset is anonymized and includes:

- Trip start day and time
- Trip end day and time
- Trip start station
- Trip end station
- Rider type (Member, Single Ride, and Day Pass)

The data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it was secure).

## Data Usage

This dataset can be used by policy makers, transportation professionals, web developers, designers, or anyone who is curious about bike sharing patterns. It can be downloaded, mapped, animated, or brought to life in any way that serves your purpose.
