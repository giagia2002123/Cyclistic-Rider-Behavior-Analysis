# Cyclistic-Rider-Behavior-Analysis

This project aims to analyze the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes by annual members and casual riders. By comparing the behavior of these two groups, I hope to answer the question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

The analysis will be based on historical trip data provided by Cyclistic. I will use data visualization and statistical methods to identify trends and patterns in the data.

The results of this analysis will provide valuable insights into the behavior of Cyclistic's customers and can be used to inform business decisions and marketing strategies.

This project is a part of Google Data Analytics: Capstone Project Course provided on Coursera.

## Divvy Bike Sharing Data

The Divvy Bike Sharing data is a comprehensive dataset that provides historical trip data for public use. This data is released on a monthly schedule and is provided according to the Divvy Data License Agreement.

### Data Content

Each trip in the dataset is anonymized and includes:

- Trip start day and time
- Trip end day and time
- Trip start station
- Trip end station
- Rider type (Member, Single Ride, and Day Pass)
- member_casual: The main label of the dataset

The data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it was secure).

### Data Usage

This dataset can be used by policy makers, transportation professionals, web developers, designers, or anyone who is curious about bike sharing patterns. It can be downloaded, mapped, animated, or brought to life in any way that serves your purpose.

### Source

The Divvy Bikesharing dataset is publicly available at [Divvy Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using R and Tableau. R will be used for data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis, while Tableau will be used for data visualization and exploration.

The analysis will follow these steps:

1. Data cleaning: The raw data will be imported into R and cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies.
2. Data manipulation: The cleaned data will be manipulated in R to create new variables or aggregate the data as needed for the analysis.
3. Descriptive statistics: Summary statistics will be calculated in R to describe the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
4. Data visualization: The results of the statistical analysis will be visualized using Tableau to create useful charts.
5. Result interpretation: The visualizations and statistical results will be interpreted to draw conclusions about the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes by annual members and casual riders.

This methodology provides a rigorous and systematic approach to analyzing the data and answering the research question.

## Results and Conlusion

The results and conclusion of this analysis will be presented in the report file which can be founded on the Documents folder.
